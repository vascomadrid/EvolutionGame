Basic Game Design: I watched and coded along with a video by Ania Kubow, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeUGlSl2i4Q, called "Build PACMAN in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS | Ania Kubow," so a lot of my code looks very similar. 
All credit for basic functionality of the game goes to Ania Kubow. 
                                                
My Edits: I edited the css code to fit the movie theme and the javascript to match the new game objects. I fixed some problems with scared-ghost/pacman collisions not registering quickly. I also added a start and clear button.
